<h1>Why does water pollution matter?</h1>
<p class="left">
Water Pollution can accumulate in lakes in river, causing severe harm to marine life, like fish and crabs. The humans who then eat these fish may also be harmed by the pollutants. Some effects include immune suppression, acute poisoning, or even reproductive failure. Sometimes, sewage gets into fresh water, causing microbial pollution. Especially potent in developing countries, microbial pollutants can cause cholera and typhoid fever. All pollutants reduces the quality of fresh water for both humans and marine life.
